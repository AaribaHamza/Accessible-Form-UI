# Accessible-Form-UI 
<br>
Hi, for this project, "Accessible Form UI," I worked with two technologies: HTML and CSS.
<br>
In this project, you will learn about different elements:
<br>
Labeling: You will learn how to use the <label> element for each form field, ensuring it is clearly associated with the input using the for attribute. This is essential for improving accessibility and making your form usable for all users, including those relying on screen readers.
Focus State: You'll apply CSS to style the focus state of each input field. This makes it easy for users navigating with a keyboard to see which field is currently active, which is an important accessibility feature.
Error Messaging: You will learn how to implement error messaging within the form. This includes adding space for error messages that are clearly linked to the relevant input field, helping users understand and correct their mistakes easily.
ARIA Attributes: You will apply ARIA attributes like aria-required for mandatory fields and aria-invalid for fields with errors, improving the form’s accessibility for users with assistive technologies.
Color Contrast: While working on the design, you will focus on ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background to meet WCAG standards, helping users with visual impairments.
Interactive Elements: You’ll also ensure that interactive elements, such as a password visibility toggle button, are fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers, providing clear feedback on their current state (e.g., “Password is hidden” or “Password is visible”).
By following these guidelines, you will learn how to create a more inclusive, accessible user experience. Once the project is completed, you can test the form UI with a screen reader or tools like Axe or Lighthouse to identify any accessibility issues and make necessary improvements.
